The Central Product Classification (CPC) code constitutes a complete product classification covering all goods and services - in our dataset we are only interested Section 0 and 2 which covers (0) Agriculture, forestry and fishery products, and (2) Food products
We specifically use the subclass, but each code is made up of a Section, Division, Group, Class, Subclass and specific Subclass.

each code is made up of a 5 digit number, an optional decimal point, followed by 2 optional digits

For example:
Ocra has the code: 01239.01
    0----.-- represents the Section: Agriculture, forestry and fishery products
    01---.-- represents the Division: Products of agriculture, horticulture and market gardening
    012--.-- represents the Group: Vegetables
    0123-.-- represents the Class: Fruit-bearing vegetables
